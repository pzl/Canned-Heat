=========================

This repo is dedicated to the educational benefit of a tear-down, study, and reverse-engineering of the electrical components of the late-90s remote control toy car, the Canned Heat.

In this Repo
----------------

* Pictures identifying the toy
* Pictures of the circuit boards of both the car and controller
* Schematic (eagle file) of both boards
* Data sheet for primary ICs used (Realtek RX2/TX2)
* Logic-analyzer data (Saleae Logic, exported as CSV)

---

### Todo
* schematic for receiver board
* capture data from car
* proper library for TX2/RX2 components
* component values in schematic
* board layout?
* investigate captured data
* look for any board revision differences
